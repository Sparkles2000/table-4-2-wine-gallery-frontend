------MVP------
As a customer I should be able to
	Art Session Artwork-----See the artwork on the Couples Walk the Art online display venue

				Have thier artwork removed with the touch of a click
				Rate the artwork
				Have thier artwork removed with the touch of a click

	Wine--------------------See a list of wines on the menue
				See indivisual wine one by one
				Order wine from the menue
				If a wine is not in stock it will show temporarily out of stock
				If a wine is discontinued it will be deleted from the online menue
				A new wine can be added multiple people can buy the same type of wine
				A wine can be rated by customers
	Customer Status---------A customer group can update thier customer status or no longer be a customer if they choose

--Stretch Goal--
A small menue of Chocolates, Chocolate Covered Strawberries and Cherries, Cheeses, Orderve Crackers, Specialty Meats, and 
Fruit will all be on the menu in thier own individual categories categories I also would like to seporate the wines into dry or sweet in an updated version of my app.
I would also like to have online event displays of upcoming events like a wine and cheese tasting event
I was also thinking of adding booking sessions and in those booking sessions you can drop down the menu for the type of session and packages for sessions.

	
This is a Wine Gallery online Menue And Venue meant for online orders of wine and displaying of artworks created from art sessions in the Wine Gallery.
It is mainly meant for Couples to share a romantic art and wine session with each other although you can also go alone or just with friends.
It is a good experience for all.
